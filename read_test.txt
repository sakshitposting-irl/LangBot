Story no. 2
It is a rare occurrence for individuals of ordinary standing such as John and myself to secure lodging in 
ancestral estates during the summer months. However, on one auspicious occasion, we found ourselves 
in possession of such an opportunity. Our temporary abode was a colonial mansion, imbued with 
historical significance and an undeniable aura of antiquity. Despite its palpable atmosphere of mystery 
and intrigue, little did we anticipate the extraordinary events that were soon to unfold within its 
hallowed halls. But I will proudly declare that there was something weird about the mansion, else why 
then is this place rented out so cheaply? And why has it been empty for so long? Well, John just 
chuckles at my questions, but hey, that's marriage for you. John's about as practical as they come. He's 
got no time for faith, hates anything superstitious, and scoffs at stuff you can't touch or see or measure. 
He's a doctor, so I guess that explains it. But maybe (and I won’t tell to anyone but this paper), maybe 
that's why I'm not getting better as fast as I should. He just doesn't believe I'm really sick! And what 
can one do in a situation like that?
When a respected physician, particularly one's own husband, reassures friends and family that one's 
condition is nothing more than a fleeting bout of nervousness or a mild tendency towards hysteria, what
course of action is left to take? Even my brother, who is also a reputable physician, agrees with my 
husband. So here I am, following their advice, taking phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is—
along with tonics, going on trips, getting fresh air, and exercising, all while being strictly forbidden 
from any "work" until I'm back to normal. But between you and me, I don't quite see eye to eye with 
them on this. Personally, I believe that engaging in fulfilling work, with a bit of excitement and variety, 
would actually be good for me. But what's a person supposed to do? I did manage to sneak in some 
writing despite their objections, but it really takes a toll on me. Having to be so sneaky about it or else 
face opposition—it's exhausting, let me tell you.
Sometimes I can't help but wonder if my condition would improve with less opposition and more social
interaction and stimulation. But John insists that the worst thing I can do is dwell on my condition, and 
I have to admit, it always leaves me feeling down. So I'll leave that topic be and shift the conversation 
to the house itself. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite 
three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are 
hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people. 
The garden is simply delightful! I've never laid eyes on such a magnificent garden before. It's spacious 
and shaded, with pathways bordered by neatly trimmed box hedges, and adorned with long arbors 
covered in grapevines, offering inviting seats beneath them. There were also greenhouses, though now 
they are all broken. It seems there was some legal dispute, possibly concerning the rightful heirs. In any
case, the property has been vacant for years. Well, that might spoil the ghostly allure a bit, I suppose, 
but truth be told, I'm not too bothered. There's still something weird about the house—I can sense it.
I even mentioned it to John one moonlit evening, but he dismissed what I felt as mere imagination and 
promptly closed the window. I find myself unreasonably irritable with John at times. I'm certain I wasn't always so easily upset. I attribute it to this nervous condition of mine. However, John insists that
giving in to such feelings would indicate a lack of proper self-control. So, I make a concerted effort to 
rein in my emotions—at least in his presence—and that leaves me feeling utterly drained.
I do not like our room at all. I had my heart set on one downstairs, opening onto the veranda, with roses
adorning the windows and lovely old-fashioned chintz hangings. But John wouldn't entertain the idea. 
He argued that there was only one window and not enough space for two beds, and no nearby room for 
him if he were to take another.
He's incredibly attentive and caring, hardly letting me move without giving me specific instructions. I 
have a strict schedule prescribed for every hour of the day; he assumes all responsibility for me, and 
yet, I can't help but feel terribly ungrateful for not appreciating it more. He claimed that our journey 
here was solely for my benefit, that I was meant to have complete rest and all the fresh air I could 
possibly need. "Your exercise," he said, "depends on your strength, my dear, and your food somewhat 
on your appetite, but air—you can absorb that all the time." So, we settled into the nursery at the top of 
the house. It's a spacious, airy room, occupying nearly the entire floor, with windows offering views in 
every direction and plenty of fresh air and sunlight streaming in. It seems to have served as a nursery 
initially, then transformed into a playroom and gymnasium, judging by the bars on the windows meant 
for little children's safety and the rings and other equipment fixed into the walls. The paint and 
wallpaper appear as though they've endured the wear and tear of a boys' school. The paper is peeling 
off in large patches all around the head of my bed, stretching as far as I can reach, and there's a 
significant area on the other side of the room where it's worn down near the floor. I've never seen such 
shabby wallpaper in all my life. The wallpaper has a wild design that breaks all the rules of art. It's 
boring enough to make your eyes lose track of where it's going, but it's also so bold that it keeps 
bothering you and making you look closer. And when you try to follow its weird lines, they suddenly 
change direction in a confusing way and end up making no sense at all. The wallpaper has a dull but 
bright orange color in some spots and a sickly yellowish tint in others. It's no wonder the children 
disliked it! I'd dislike it too if I had to stay in this room for long. Here comes John, so I have to stop 
writing— he doesn't like it when I write anything.
***********************************************************************************
It's been two weeks since we arrived here, and I haven't felt like writing since that first day. But now, 
I'm sitting by the window in this awful nursery, and there's nothing stopping me from writing as much 
as I want, except for my lack of strength. John is away all day, and sometimes even at night when he 
has serious cases to attend to. I'm thankful that my condition isn't serious! But these nervous problems 
really get me down. John doesn't realize how much I'm truly suffering. He thinks there's no real reason 
for me to be in such pain, and that's enough for him. Of course, it's just nerves. But it really bothers me 
not to be able to do my duties properly! I wanted to be a great help to John, to provide real support and 
comfort, but here I am feeling like a bit of a burden already! It's hard for anyone to understand how 
much effort it takes just to do the little I'm capable of—getting dressed, entertaining, and managing 
things around the house. I'm lucky that Mary is so good with the baby. Such a sweet little thing!
But I find it nerve-wracking to be around him. I guess John has never experienced nervousness in his 
life. He makes fun of me for being so bothered by this wallpaper! At first, he planned to redo the wallpaper in the room. But later, he claimed that I was allowing it to affect me too much, and that it 
was detrimental for a nervous patient to indulge in such fancies. He argued that even if we changed the 
wallpaper, I would find something else to fret over—the heavy bedstead, the barred windows, the gate 
at the top of the stairs, and so forth. "You know staying here is beneficial for you," he said. "And 
honestly, my dear, I'm not interested in renovating the house for just a three-month rental."
"Then can't we at least move downstairs?" I suggested. "There are such lovely rooms there."
At that, he hugged me and affectionately called me a silly goose. He agreed to go down to the cellar if I
wanted, even offering to have it whitewashed while he was at it. But he's correct about the beds and 
windows and such. It's a spacious and cozy room, just what anyone could ask for. And, of course, I 
wouldn't be so foolish as to make him uncomfortable just because of a whim. I'm actually starting to 
quite like this big room, except for that dreadful wallpaper. From one window, I can see the garden—
the mysterious, shadowy arbors, the riotous display of old-fashioned flowers, and the twisted, gnarled 
trees. From another window, I have a lovely view of the bay and a small private dock that belongs to 
the estate. There's a beautiful shaded lane that leads down there from the house. Sometimes I imagine 
seeing people walking along the various paths and arbors, but John has warned me against indulging in 
such fancies. He believes that with my vivid imagination and tendency to create stories, a nervous 
condition like mine could easily lead to all sorts of exaggerated ideas, and that I should use my 
willpower and good judgment to control these tendencies. So, I do my best to heed his advice.
Sometimes I think that if I were well enough to write a bit, it would help ease the weight of all these 
thoughts and give me some peace. But I've noticed that I get pretty exhausted when I try. It's 
disheartening not to have any guidance or companionship with my writing. When I'm fully recovered, 
John says we can invite Cousin Henry and Julia for a long visit. But he also says he'd sooner put 
fireworks in my pillowcase than have those lively folks around while I'm still recovering.
But I mustn't dwell on that now. This wallpaper seems to taunt me with its malevolent influence! 
There's a particular spot where the pattern seems to droop like a broken neck, and two bulbous eyes 
leer at you from upside down.
